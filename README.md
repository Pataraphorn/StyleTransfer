# StyleTransfer
**This project is a part of senior project "Your Art Painter".**

The purpose of this project has 2 main purposes. First is to study Neural Style Transfer and develop neural style transfer
that can apply with Thai artist style image. This project focus on 2 Thai artists who are Chakrabhand Posayakrit and
Chalood Nimsamer. The style transfer is using by transfer learning called VGG19 for feature extraction to train human
image, animal image and Thai artwork. Then create new neural style transfer image. In additional, we used histogram
matching and luminance matching for color preservation (new created image has similarity color with content image).
Second purpose is to create your art painter web application for used our developed
